## Computer

- compute --> which is colculate
- computer --> a machine
- two types of computer

  - analog computer --> a value is not Accuracy approximate (ex: normal weighing machine, temprature thermometer, Speedometer)
  - digital computer --> it gives accurate resultes (ex: digital calculater, digital bp machine, digital weighing machines , all the electronic devices)

  - HardWare ==> Physical things / components
    - Things which we can feel in sense.
  - Software ==> Non Physical Things / Components
    - All the programming languages, package, DB Software, OS
    - which we can't feeling sense.
    - Ex: java, ms office, c, c++, photoshop,

#### Software type

- Languages and Packages
  - Package ==> MsOffice (Ms Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Paint) ---> writtens visual basic language --> C++
  - Languages ==> C, C++, Python, Java, C#, Oracle, Extra
  - Packages are written by a languages
- Tally Accounting Package
- SAP ERP Package

- What are the different software package

#### RAM Memory(Primary Memory) - ROM Memory(Secondary Memory - Hard Disk)

- RAM ==> Temporary Memory Area / Main Memory / Physical Memory
  - We give a input in computers. the inputs is called data.
- ROM (HDD --> Hard Disk Drive) ==> Permenant Memory Area.

#### Computer

1. Laptop
2. System
3. Desktop
4. PC
5. Machine
6. Workstation
7. Server
8. Host

- Applications also called Software
- DB Layer ==> DATA BASE Layer ( DataBase is software) --> Retrive data very faster
- Which stores a data in an organizing way
- Hana and Max and Sybase DB sap database
- DB2 - IBM
- Scated Way --> UnStructure data storing in HDD
- Encripted data ==> Data Mashing.

#### OS --> Operating System (Platform)

- 1. First layer - OS --> bridge between the user and hardware
- 2. Second layer - Software
- Two types of operating system

  1. GUI -->Graphical User Interface Operating System - User Friendly OS. (All windows operating system)
  2. CUI -->Charactor User Interface OS. (LINUX, UNIX, UBUNTU, MSDOS- MicroSoft Desktop Operating System)

  - The first operating system MSDOS --> invented by BillGates.

- SAP install panna windows highlevel os venum.

- Sharing of Resources
- Inter Connected of Devices is called Network.
- Connecting Diff Systems /Devices / pcs

- Local Area Network (LAN)
- Server PC (Which serves the Data)
- Central Strage of Data
- Systems are connected to a particular PC
- Share the Resources
- Computer Resources (RAM Memory, HDD Capacity, CUP Capacity, OS)
- REsources Configuration

- SSD --> Solid State Disk

#### Internet (Network of Networks)

- WAN --> Wired Area Network

#### IP Address --> Internet Protocal Address

- command prompt --> ipconfig to get system ip address
- Host Name / System Name

- System Information this is gives about system Configuration (windows -> System information)

#### Data Measurements

- System can understand only binary values
- Decimal Number System ---> totally 10 numbers ( 0 - 9)
- Binary Number System ---> tatally 2 numbers ( 0 and 1 )
- Each digits equals to 1 bits
- Each 8 bits is equals to 1 byte
- 1024 bytes = 1kb, 1024 kb = 1mb, 1024 mb = 1gb, 1024gb = 1tb, 1024 mb = 1pg

- Partition, ERP
