# Difference Between HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
 ## What is HTTP/2
  - HTTP/2 is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol, designed to improve web page load times and overall performance by reducing latency and overhead. It
## Advantages of HTTP/2
  ### Multiplexing:
-  HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single TCP (Transfer Control Protocal) connection concurrently, unlike HTTP/1
 ###  Header Compression:
- HTTP/2 uses HPACK, a header compression algorithm, to reduce the size of HTTP headers transmitted between client and server

## what is HTTP/3
- Header Compression:
HTTP/2 uses HPACK, a header compression algorithm, to reduce the size of HTTP headers transmitted between client and server

### What it is:
- HTTP/3 is the successor to HTTP/2, and it builds upon the foundation of HTTP/1.1. 

## Benefits:
### Faster speeds:
- By using QUIC over UDP (User Datagram Protocal), HTTP/3 can establish connections and transfer data more quickly than HTTP/2, which uses TCP. 
### Improved security:
- QUIC provides stronger security features, making HTTP/3 a more secure option than previous versions. 
### More stable connections:
- HTTP/3's connection ID (CID) feature helps maintain connections even when a client switches networks or devices, resulting in a more stable and reliable experience. 

## Why is a new version of HTTP needed?
- QUIC helps fix some of HTTP/2's biggest shortcomings:
