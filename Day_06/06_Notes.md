  ## Rest Operator -
  - ... Rest = collecting remaining values
 -  Rest = Spread  (this is a beginner level understanding (= Assignment operator) )
 - A rest element must be a ***last element***. if it does not get any value it will always empty array.

 ## Array Destructuring  
 ## Object Destructuring
 - inside the object can have only unique key. if you write two time same key it is override the value.

 ## Functions 

 ## Scope   ==> Life time of variable
 ### two types 
  - block scope ***{}*** (ex: if, else if, else, for loop, while loop, ) 
    
  - function scope ***function sum(){}***
  - Lexical Scope

  Use practicepen website to practice js code\

  - {} creates a block. 
- not defined error

- let  & const --> Block scope
- var cannot escape fuction scope. Also let and const cannot escape function scope.
### Lexical Scope 
  - Closure (Own Scope + Lexical Scope) 
  - Outer of the function scope is global scope

### Just in Compailation ==> (JIT) (JavaScript engine works in JIT)
# Hoisting 
- ***2 Phase Execution.***
- 1. Compilation
- 2. Execution

- JS Guy (JS Engine ===> it Execute the code line by line), 
- Context(Execuution Context  ==> To keep note of all the variables and its value)

### TDZ --> Temporal Dead Zone - let, const
## Compilation Phase --> Only Declaration Noted
### pseduo code
