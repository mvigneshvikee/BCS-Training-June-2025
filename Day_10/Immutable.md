# Immutable js library
- eslint => restrict the configured rules. it is telling about style of coding. 
    - ex: we set avoid deprecated methods strictly.

- map accepts function an argument. so its called HOF

- Humble Braging => suyaperumai pesubavar.
- Brain Stoming ==> Throwing ideas

## Code Quality - 5 Pillars
1. Readability - 75%            => Read Only 
    - Giving meaning full variable names. Declarative 
2. Maintainbility
    - Code Debt, Reuse 
3. Extensibility --> Camera
4. Testability  (Easy to testing. )
5. Perfomance => Time Comlexity
    . O(n) -> number of elements in the array. Time comlexity.  O(n), O(n^2-Squre), O(n^3-Cube), O(2n)  Lienear, Expodentioal

- Refactoring ==> (Output same, Quality inncreased)
- Code Debt => (It is not good quality code. tomorrow will make it better but never changed better. this type cases code debt more complex. )
- Declarative ==> What to do  (ex: map())
- Imperative => How to do

- Cypress => javascript testing site

- .toString() array [] --> converts string. object --> [object object]

## Waterfall vs Agile (Scrum => Sprint = 14 Days)

- Ring Release  windows update release method
- sprint two weeks once release in agile methodolagy

- Sprint Planning => the process going on over all 2 hours. Assigning Story Points.
- Story Point => Bug Solving time period. It depends on Bugs reloving. 1 Story Point = ! Day.
- First 10 mins Standup Meeting  => Discuss about yesterday's work and today's work. Blocker -> Someone told i cant work this ticket. 
- Over Flow => 0 Over flow is best. Its jump next sprit. 
- Sprint Review(Demo) || Sprit Retrospective(Better)

## KANBAN Board

- Todo ==> Current tickets
- Backlog ==> It will takes later
- Priority => P0 > p1 > p2 
- `Ad hoc` Tickets  => without planning tickets. its create craf `spike ^`.
- Burn Down Chart 
- Ruff Estimations ==> TShirt size. Its only backlog tickets
